# CMU MSML (Advanced Study) ‚Äì Research Prep & Portfolio
> **Primary Goal:** This repository aims to pull links together, and organize a format that brings faculty, students, and researchers closer together. 
> **Secondary Goal:** Deepen theory (probabilistic graphical models, RL, ML theory) and extend it into **scalable, reproducible, and trustworthy** ML systems. This repo tracks coursework prep, research scaffolding, and reproducible code toward CMU‚Äôs **MS in Machine Learning ‚Äì Advanced Study** and a pathway into research with 1) **ICSD** or 2) **Safe AI Lab**.

## üß≠ Research Tracks (What this repo advances)

1. **Trustworthy Forecasting & Infrastructure Readiness**  
   - Stabilizing time-series models (e.g., SARIMA-aware LSTMs), seed-sensitivity studies, and seasonality/heteroskedasticity controls for energy + compute demand planning.  
   - Reproducibility guarantees (multi-seed protocols, deterministic configs, artifact logging).

2. **Evaluation Science & Auditing (ICSD-aligned)**  
   - Methods for robust evaluation, peer-review modeling/assignment, and bias auditing; bridging formal theory with applied pipelines and data-centric checks.

3. **Safe RL & Agents (Safe AI Lab-aligned)**  
   - Safety in control/decision-making under uncertainty; sim-to-real considerations; verification hooks in RL pipelines.

4. **Community**
   - This repository aims to pull links together, and organize a format that brings faculty, students, and researchers closer together. 

# üî¨ Research Milestones (proposed)

**Spring 2026**
- Apply Intelligent Systems and Robotics and Probability/Simulation to a relevant project, build upon capstone and deepen knowledge, await for feedback. 

**Summer 2026, if accepted**
Reach back out to Dr. Shah, show progress, and see next steps. Try to align early and begin research.

## Research

- Begin on work purposed in [Research](https://github.com/EthanNorton/MSML-alignment/tree/research)
- Rebuild forecasting pipeline with stricter determinism; publish a reproducibility report (R¬≤ distributions vs seeds; calibration).
- Draft an evaluation taxonomy for LLM auditing (annotation robustness; agreement modeling; reviewer assignment framing).

 - [Machine Learning with graphs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yiming/Syllabus.pdf)
   -[Insert branch]

## Continue into research, build thesis foundations. 

**Summer**
# TBD based off lessons learned from previious semester, probably research. 
Safe RL prototype in a simulator (risk constraints, verification hooks).
Submit a short workshop paper (reproducibility or evaluation).


**Electives to focus on**
- To be updated.
- Deep Reinforcement Learning, Graduate Artificial Intelligence. 
üßë‚Äçüè´ **Advising Fit & Notes (living)**
With Prof. Nihar Shah: evaluation science, peer-review modeling, theory with deployments.

With Prof. Atoosa Kasirzadeh: AI governance/ethics methods integrated with technical pipelines and evaluation.

With Safe AI Lab: verification-minded RL/agents and safety for high-stakes systems.

-Problem Statement: Think high level how to tie all three together. It may take some time. 

Maintain running notes, alignment, and annotations.
